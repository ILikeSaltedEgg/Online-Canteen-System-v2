        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Arellano Online Canteen! This project aims to provide a convenient and accessible platform for students, faculty, and staff to order food from the comfort of their lounge or classrooms. By leveraging technology, we aim to improve the overall canteen experience by offering a seamless and efficient food ordering system.</p>
        <p>This project is being developed by a guy of a Grade 12 Senior High School from Arellano High School as part of his research project for the school year 2025. The group's goal is to make food ordering faster, easier, and more organized for the entire school community.</p>
